## Notes

My own builds are made using Bun, the `bun.lockb` is included in the repo
Uses `wxt`, `react` and `react-markdown`.

## Instructions to build

Can probably use npm / pnpm / etc if you want.

Bun:

```
bun install
bun run zip:firefox
```

output will be in `.output/tab-funnel-VERSION-firefox.zip`
